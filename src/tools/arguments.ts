/**
 * How a tool's arguments are declared, and what happens to one that is not.
 *
 * An argument this server does not declare is a question it cannot answer.
 * Reading it and dropping it produces an answer computed on the defaults, which
 * a caller reads as the answer to what they asked. So an undeclared argument is
 * refused, and the refusal names it and offers the declared name when one is
 * close enough to be the one that was meant.
 *
 * A caller branches on the code a refusal opens with, and arguments are refused
 * along two paths: the code of a tool writes its own refusals, and the schema
 * refuses on its own before that code runs. Both open with the same code here,
 * so a caller reading the vocabulary finds it whichever path refused.
